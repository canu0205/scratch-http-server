# Scratch HTTP Server

A simple HTTP server built in Go to practice networking fundamentals and basic server design.

## Overview

This project implements a minimal HTTP server from scratch using Go's `net/http` package.
It was created as a learning exercise to deepen understanding of:

- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Setting up custom routing
- Writing concurrent and stateless servers

## Features

- Basic HTTP GET endpoint
- Dynamic route handling
- JSON response encoding
- Modular server structure for extensibility
- Lightweight and fast

## Why This Project?

Learning to build a web server from scratch is a fundamental step toward understanding:

- Stateless communication protocols (HTTP)
- Server concurrency in Go (via Goroutines)
- Real-world server architecture

This project serves as a stepping stone toward building more complex backend systems and understanding blockchain networking layers.
